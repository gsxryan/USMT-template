# USMT-template
Microsoft User State Migration Tool.  Utilizing example configuration to optimize the User and Admin experience.  

### Context
1. This was created before OneDrive was optimized for Desktop backup and restore where transfer speeds are no longer as essential for optimizing T2 workflows.
2. This includes data directories that are not in standard OneDrive Protected folders (ALL C:\USERcreated-dirs)

 One Click actions.  The goal is to create a standard with zero drift, so technicians are not stuck deciding how to backup a users machine in a custom manner, greatly accelerating the pace for desktop migration completion.  Service tickets post migration are also greatly reduced due to grabbing more custom directories, settings, etc as detailed below.
Additional strategies include copying data as quickly as possible using USB 3.0 & SSD. Resulting in 5-20x reduced time for machine processing.  Additionally, this enables remote servicing, so less on-site presence is required.

Many thanks to Ehlertech for the publicly available XML References.  These were modified to build this custom solution.

NOTE: USMT.exe is a binary compiled from sourcecode/USMT.ps1 using Powershell to EXE compiler.  The reason for this is to make execution of the script less steps for T2, and better standardization with the mobility of mounted drives / USB.
